# Adiabatic Contraction Calculation

This directory contains scripts and tools to calculate the final dark matter density using **Adiabatic Contraction (AC)** 

## How to Use

You can perform the AC calculation by running the following command:

```bash
python3 adiabatic_contraction.py "sim_name" "path_to_input_table"
```
Where the input table can be created using prep_input.ipynb
